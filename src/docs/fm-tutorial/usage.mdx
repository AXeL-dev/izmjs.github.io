Functional Modules are Node.js packages that implement izmjs APIs. For larger, more complex apps, Functional Modules let you modularize your app customizations into app-specific plugins.
izmjs is designed to be extensible, which means functional modules can extend and modify just about everything izmjs does.
Of the many possibilities, Functional Modules can:

ðŸ‘‰ Reuse common functionality like chat, auth, etcâ€¦

ðŸ‘‰ Streamline common tasks and improve development workflow
