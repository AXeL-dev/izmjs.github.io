> This tutorial assumes that you have some experience with [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/)

In this tutorial, we will walkthrough on how to create your own reusable functional module,
There are three ways to create functional modules:

1 - The Devtools home screen

2 - The terminal by running this command on your terminal

```bash
npm run generate:module
```

3 - Create them manually from scratch

To show you how functional modules work under the hood we will go with the third approach, in your text editor go under `/modules` and create a new folder call it `todo` you can call it whatever seems fit but we'll be making a todo module, that's a simple rest API for todos with a simple [CRUD](link/to/crud) to familiarize yourself with izmjs.

In your terminal change directories to `/todo` and initialize it

```bash
cd todo
npm init -y
```
