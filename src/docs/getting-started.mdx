## Getting Started

> This tutorial assumes that you have both [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/) installed on your machine

you can get up and running with izmjs by either running this command on your terminal:

```bash
npx izm
```

You will get promted to configure your app:

![izmjs-cli](../images/cli/izm_cli_1.png)

After that it'll ask you what [Functional Modules](/functional-modules) you want to use:

![izmjs-cli-modules](../images/cli/izm_cli_2.png)

After you follow the instructions, and all the Dependencies have been Installed change the directories to the root of the project and then you can start your project by using:

```bash
npm start
```

or if you're using yarn

```bash
yarn start
```

when the App starts you should see something like this on the terminal Indicating that your App have been started successfully

![app-start-up](../images/cli/izm_cli_6.png)

Congratulations you've successfully sat up izm and you can see your app at the port you've chosen for it on the browser
