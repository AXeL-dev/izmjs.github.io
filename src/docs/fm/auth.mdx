## Authentication & Authorization

This guide will show you how to work with the izm's built-in Authentication and Authorization system.

izmjs uses IAM (Identity access management) to manage users and their roles, and we will be using this (simple API) to show you how you could easily manage your app's Authentication and Authorization using izm, start off by launching your app by running

```bash
npm start
```

We're going to be using [Postman](link/to/postman) to make the http requests to the server. This [guide](link/to/postman/guide) show's you how to setup Postman and izm together
